This is a project contains the code written for the thesis: "web mining applications for competitor analysis and disruption detection" 

To get the code running the following steps have to be executed:
===============================================================
1. Check-out the repository

2. Get pre-trained Doc2Vec model [English Wikipedia (1.4GB)](https://ibm.box.com/s/3f160t4xpuya9an935k84ig465gvymm2)

3. Put the files for the model into /model/

4. Setup a mysql database and create a schema called "disruptuion_detection"

5. Execute the SQL-script (/SQL/create_table.sql) on the created schema
